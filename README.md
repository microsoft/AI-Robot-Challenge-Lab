# AI Robot Challenge

The future is the fusion of AI and robotics to enable intelligent, collaborative, assistive, and social robots that augment human ingenuity. If you want to take the AI Robot Challenge but are new to robotics, each day we will present an Intro to Robotics session. In this session, you will learn about the heart of robotics programming using the Robot Operating system (ROS) with Python and how to use Gazebo, the robot simulator. You will also learn how to deploy your code to a real industrial robot. This lab will give you the confidence to start your journey with intelligent collaborative robotics.

# Introduction to Robotics

## Summary of technologies used

### **ROS**

ROS (Robot Operating System) is robotics middleware licensed under an open source, BSD license. Althought ROS is not an Operative System, it provides libraries, hardware abstraction, device drivers, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and other tools to help software developers create robot applications.

Last Release: ROS Melodic Morenia. Supported on Ubuntu Artful and Bionic, along with Debian Stretch. 
Supports collaboration throught Repositories.
ROS is a distributed framework of processes (aka Nodes) that enables executables to be individually added, which makes the framework very modular. These processes can be grouped into Packages and Stacks, which can be easily shared and distributed.

Althought there are some Robotics Kits available in the market, ROS is quickly becoming the new standard for both industrial and research robotics as it integrates both hardware and software in their solution for industrial applications.

**Languages:** Python 2.7

**System Requirements:** Ubuntu 16.04

**Other Supported Technologies (reference only)**
C++ and Lisp

Supports Unix-based systems, primarly Ubuntu and Mac OS X systems, but the community has been adding support to Fedora, Gentoo, Arch Linux and other Linux platforms.


### **Gazebo**

Gazebo is a 3D robot simulation tool that seamlessly integrates with ROS, which allows to run the Gazebo server in a ROS environment. Gazebo allows to build 3D scenarios on your computer with robots, using obstacles and other objects. This allows to test robots in complex or dangerous scenarios without any harm to the real robot. Most of the time it is faster and cost effective to simply run a simulator instead of starting the whole scenario on a real robot. It uses a physics engines for realistic movements called ODE (Open Dynamics Engine).

Gazebo has two main components: the server which acts like a back-end to compute all the logic for your testing scenarios and a client which works as a graphical front-end. This is very useful as sometimes you might only want to execute the tests without the UI in order to speed up the execution process.
Gazebo was used to simulate the atlas robot for the Virtual Robotics Challenge (the precursor to the DARPA robotics challenge), which required to build a software simulation of humanoid rescue work.

**Languages:** C++ API

**System Requirements:** Linux


### **RViz**

RViz is an Open Source 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.
Uses sensors data and custom visualization markers to develop robot capabilities in a 3d environment.
Features:
  - Motion planning: the process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement.
  - Object detection: vizualization and recognition of objects using the camera, for example recognizing cubes of different colors.
  - Calibration: geometric camera calibration is used to estimate parameters internal to the camera that affect the image processing.
  - Debugging
  - RViz visualization widget
  - 3D stereo rendering, using 2 connected cameras to display 3D images, it displays a different view to each eye so that the scene appears to have depth.
RViz provides a CLI tool that lets you execute python or c++ scripts with controls.

### **Sawyer**

Sawyer is an integrated collaborative robot (aka cobot) solution designed with embedded vision, smart swappable grippers, and high resolution force control. The robot purpose is to automate specific industrial repetive tasks, it comes with an arm that has a gripper which can be easily replaced by one of the available options from the ClickSmart Gripper Kit.
Features:
  - Sawyer comes with highly sensitive torque sensors embedded into every joint, this allows you to control force where delicate part insertion is critical, or use force if needed. It can maneuver into tight spaces and it has a long reach of 1260 mm (50 inches) max.
  - Comes with an embedded vision system used for the robot positioning, it also allows external vision systems like cameras.
  - Fast to deploy as many pieces are plug&play with integrated sensors.

### **MoveIt!**

MoveIt is software for motion and path planning. Users can access actions and services using: C++, Python, Through a GUI.
Features:
  - Manipulation
  - Motion planning: the process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement.
  - 3D perception: allows the robot to extract 3D information from the world and their own movements so that they accomplish navigation and manipulation tasks.
  - Kinematics: geometry for moving the arms.
  - Control and navigation: underneath it uses OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) and requires a controller to send messages to the hardware. MoveIt provides a Fake Controller to interact with the hardware using ROS messages but you can replace the fake robot controller in MoveIt with your own plugin which controls the robot if needed.
The planning scene feature allows to monitor the state, sensor and world geometry information.

# Getting started  

Microsoft Bot Framework and Cognitive Services provide a platform to develop intelligent bots. Bot Framework allows us to develop bots in different languages and by adding congitive services to the bot, we are able to make our bot smart and have capabilities like language understanding, image recognition, text recognition, translation and more. In this lab we will create a simple bot and well make this bot to communicate with a physical robot using natural language and Computer Vision for image recognition.

## Setup your environment

### Setup your Azure subscription

This lab **requires** an Azure subscription. If you delete the resources at the end of the session, total charges will be less than $1 so we strongly recommend using an existing subscription if available.

If you need a new Azure subscription, then there are a couple of options to get a free subscription:

1. The easiest way to sign up for an Azure subscription is with VS Dev Essentials and a personal Microsoft account (like @outlook.com). This does require a credit card; however, there is a spending limit in the subscription so it won't be charged unless you explicitly remove the limit.
    * Open Microsoft Edge and go to the [Microsoft VS Dev Essentials site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/).
    * Click **Join or access now**.
    * Sign in using your personal Microsoft account.
    * If prompted, click Confirm to agree to the terms and conditions.
    * Find the Azure tile and click the **Activate** link.
1. Alternatively, if the above isn't suitable, you can sign up for a free Azure trial.
    * Open Microsoft Edge and go to the [free Azure trial page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
    * Click **Start free**.
    * Sign in using your personal Microsoft account.
1. Complete the Azure sign up steps and wait for the subscription to be provisioned. This usually only takes a couple of minutes.

  ```

### Setup Language Understanding

Language Understanding (LUIS) allows your bot to understand what a person wants in their own words. LUIS uses machine learning to allow developers to build applications that can receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.

### Create a LUIS subscription

While LUIS has a standalone portal for building the model, it uses Azure for subscription management.

Create the LUIS resource in Azure:

1. Return to the Azure Portal (++portal.azure.com++).
1. Click **Create Resource [+]**  from the left menu and search for **Language Understanding**.
1. **Select** the first result and then click the **Create** button.
1. Provide the required information:
    * App name: `robotics-luis-<your_initials>`.
    * Location: `West US`.
    * Pricing tier: `F0 (5 Calls per second, 10K Calls per month)`.
    * Create a new resource group with the name: `robotics-lab-<your initials>`.
    * **Confirm** that you read and understood the terms by **checking** the box.
1. Click **Create**. This step might take a few seconds.
1. Once the deployment is complete, you will see a **Deployment succeeded** notification.
1. Go to **All Resources** in the left pane and **search** for the new resource (`robotics-luis-<your initials>`).
1. **Click** on the resource.
1. Go to the **Keys** page.
1. Copy the **Key 1** value into **Notepad**.

    > [!NOTE] We'll need this key later on.

### Create a new LUIS App

Before calling LUIS, we need to train it with the kinds of phrases we expect our users to use.

1. Login to the [LUIS portal](www.luis.ai).

    > [!NOTE] Use the same credentials as you used for logging into Azure.
1. **Scroll down** to the bottom of the welcome page.
1. Click **Create new app**.
1. Select **United States** from the country list.
1. Check the **I agree** checkbox.
1. Click the **Continue** button.
1. From `My Apps`, click **Import new app**.
1. **Select** the base model from `~/AI-Robot-Challenge-Lab/resources/robotics-bot-luis-app.json`.
1. Click on the **Done** button.
1. **Wait** for the import to complete.
1. Click on the **Train** button and wait for it to finish.
1. Click the **Test** button to open the test panel.
1. **Type** `move arm` and press enter.

    > [!NOTE] It should return the `MoveArm` intent.

# Bringing Your Robot to Life 

We created a basic bot using the SDK V4, we'll run it locally using the Bot Framework Emulator and extend its functionality by using Language Understanding to request different operations to the robot. The code base includes a method to make the physical robot move/wave the arm, this method invokes a script that uses the **Intera SDK** to send commands to the robot.

## Implement your Bot

### Add support for Language Understanding

Let's add language understanding support to the bot.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. Click on **Open Folder** and select the `~/AI-Robot-Challenge-Lab/src/chatbot` folder that you extracted earlier.
1. Click on `talk-to-my-robot.py` to open the bot python script.
1. If prompted to install the Python Extension select Install, once installed, select **Reload** to activate the extension.
1. Click on **View -> Command Palette** from the top menu and type `Python:Select Interpreter`. You should see python 3.6 in the options, select this version.
1. Go to the `BotRequestHandler` class.
1. Modify the method `handle_message`, replace this line
  ```python
  luis_result = LuisResponse('None')
  ```

  with
  ```python
  luis_result = LuisApiService.post_utterance(activity.text)
  ```
  > [!NOTE] This method is the entry point of the bot messages, here we can see how we get the incoming request, then send it to LUIS and use the intent result to trigger specific operations, in this case it already provides support to handle the **MoveArm** intent.
1. Go to the `LuisApiService` class.
1. Modify the method `post_utterance`:
    * Add the following code after the line `Request headers and parameters`
      ```python
      headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': LUIS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}
      params = {
          # Query parameter
          'q': message,
          # Optional request parameters, set to default values
          'timezoneOffset': '0',
          'verbose': 'false',
          'spellCheck': 'false',
          'staging': 'false',
      }
      ```
    * Replace the line `return None` with the following code snippet
      ```python
      r = requests.get('https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/%s' % LUIS_APP_ID, headers=headers, params=params)
      topScoreIntent = r.json()['topScoringIntent']
      entities = r.json()['entities']
      intent = topScoreIntent['intent'] if topScoreIntent['score'] > 0.5 else 'None' 
      entity = entities[0] if len(entities) > 0 else None
      
      return LuisResponse(intent, entity['entity'], entity['type']) if entity else LuisResponse(intent)
      ```
      > [!ALERT] Check your indentation to avoid python compilation errors.
1. Save the **talk-to-my-robot.py** file.

    ```
    Add the following code snippet
    ```python
    elif luis_result.intent == 'ShowStats':
        stats = BotCommandHandler.show_stats()
        response = await BotRequestHandler.create_reply_activity(activity, stats)
        await context.send_activity(response)
    ```
1. Go to the `BotCommandHandler` class.
1. Replace the method `show_stats` content with the following code snippet:
    ```python
    print('Showing stats... do something')
    # launch your python2 script using bash

1. Replace the `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` with the subscription key previously obtained.
1. Go to the `BotRequestHandler` class.
1. Replace the content of the method `process_image` to extract and process an image from the incoming message:
    ```python
    # Check if there is an image
    image_url = BotRequestHandler.get_image_url(activity.attachments)

    if image_url:
        dominant_color = ComputerVisionApiService.analyze_image(image_url)
        response = await BotRequestHandler.create_reply_activity(activity, f'Do you need a {dominant_color} cube? Let me find one for you!')
        await context.send_activity(response)
        BotCommandHandler.move_cube(dominant_color)
    else:
        response = await BotRequestHandler.create_reply_activity(activity, 'Please provide a valid instruction or image.')

    ```
1. Go to the `ComputerVisionApiService` class.
1. Modify the method `analyze_image`:
    * Add the following code after the line `Request headers and parameters`
      ```python
      headers = {
          'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY,
          'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
      }
      params = {'visualFeatures': 'Color'}
      ```
    * Add the following code after the line `Get image bytes content` to get the image content as bytes:
      ```python
      image_data = BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content)
      ```
    * Replace the line `return None` with the following code snippet
      ```python
      print(f'Processing image: {image_url}')
      response = requests.post(COMPUTER_VISION_ANALYZE_URL, headers=headers, params=params, data=image_data)
      response.raise_for_status()
      analysis = response.json()
      dominant_color = analysis["color"]["dominantColors"][0]
      
      return dominant_color
      ```

### Add the robot code
